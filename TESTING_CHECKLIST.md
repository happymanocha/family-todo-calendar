- [ ] Interactive elements stand out

## üìã Quick Testing Script

When making UI changes, test in this order:

1. **Light Mode Desktop**
   - Test all functionality
   - Check all visual elements
   - Verify forms and validation

2. **Dark Mode Desktop**
   - Toggle dark mode
   - Check all same elements as light mode
   - Pay special attention to text visibility

3. **Mobile Light Mode**
   - Resize browser to mobile view
   - Test touch interactions
   - Check responsive layout

4. **Mobile Dark Mode**
   - Toggle dark mode on mobile view
   - Verify all elements are visible

5. **Edge Cases**
   - Very long text in fields
   - Very long names/labels
   - Empty states
   - Error states
   - Loading states

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always test dark mode** - Most visibility issues happen in dark mode
2. **Use browser DevTools** - Responsive mode for mobile testing
3. **Clear cache** - Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R) to see changes
4. **Test on real devices** - When possible, test on actual mobile devices
5. **Use contrast checkers** - Ensure WCAG compliance for accessibility

## üêõ Common Issues to Watch For

- [ ] Labels showing IDs instead of names
- [ ] Toasts/notifications appearing off-screen
- [ ] Overlapping elements on mobile

**Remember:** It's faster to test thoroughly before deploying than to fix issues after deployment!
